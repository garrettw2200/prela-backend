{
  "root_cause": "The LLM call failed due to a timeout when the model took longer than expected to generate a response for a complex multi-step reasoning task.",
  "explanation": "The trace shows that span 'llm-call-3' exceeded the 30-second timeout threshold. The input prompt contained a chain-of-thought request with 5 nested reasoning steps, which caused the model to generate an unusually long response. The upstream retry logic was not configured, leading to a hard failure.",
  "fix_suggestions": [
    "Increase the timeout for complex reasoning tasks to 60 seconds",
    "Add retry logic with exponential backoff for LLM calls",
    "Break down complex prompts into smaller, sequential calls",
    "Consider using a streaming response to detect early failures"
